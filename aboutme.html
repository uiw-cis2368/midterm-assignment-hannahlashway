        <h2 class ="intro"> Hi! I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas and I am starting my third year at UIW. 
            I've been working towards a double major with a BS in Fashion Management and in CIS.
            At home, I have a dog that I share with my boyfriend, his name is Yoshi (the dog not the boyfriend)
            and he is a two year old Shiba Inu. Yes, they are as sassy and finicky as their reputation precedes but 
            I would not change it for the world. In my free time I love to cook, read, take photos or work on my hobbies.
            I have a bit of a difficult time writing about myself so I have decided to implore the the help of some visuals and I will
            elaborate on each so you can learn how it relates to me!  </h2>

             <p class="ams"> I took this photo in Amsterdam over the summer with my 35mm film camera. I've 
                             loved photography and practiced it for many years. Obviously, when I first learnt 
                             photography, I was using a digital camera because that is the standard now, but 
                            after a few years I really started getting into film cameras and so now I shoot almost 
                            exclusively with film. While my favorite camera I have is my Rolleiflex which is a twin lens
                            camera, it is quite heavy and I only get 12 photos per film roll so I end up using my Canon AE1 
                            which is a lot lighter and gets me 36 photos per role. This particular photo has some marks and distortion
                            because when I was leaving Amsterdam the airport security was insistent that my film got put through the X-Ray 
                            machine and hence it's got some bleeding. </p>

             <p class="icarus"> I have been a long time lover and collector of vintage designer fashion. 
                                About half a year ago, I decided to take the jump and make the switch from just
                                buying and collecting for my own archive to buying and selling vintage as well. 
                                These particular heels are Gianni Versace from the late eighties or early nineties 
                                before Gianni passed away and was still designing for the brand. While I do love being 
                                able to buy and try on all of the garments and accessories I get, my favorite part is 
                                getting to research all of the pieces I buy and being able to share the history of all 
                                these pieces with other people. </p>

             <p class="vinyl"> I have been collecting records since I was about twelve and almost ten years later I have amassed quite the collection. I've got everything from The Smiths to Donna Summers and almost everything 
                                in between, except country music, I'm not really a fan unless you count Johnny Cash. One of my favorite things to do when I travel to a new city or country, is to find 
                                the local record shops and buy myself a record, or four. This photo was taken in Amsterdam when I visited over the summer and I got this and another Rolling Stones album I had been looking for 
                                for years, two Smiths albums and a Daft Punk album. One of my other great loves in life is traveling so I have additionally accumulated a decent sized collection of records 
                                from places like Montreal, New York City, Sedona, London and Amsterdam. Two of my favorite records in my collection are actually both from London, the first being an original German 
                                pressing of The Beatles "Magical Mystery Tour", the vinyl is blue, and then an Arctic Monkeys record that I originally thought was a British release only but turns out it is actually 
                                like a black market, fan-made vinyl which is also pretty cool.  </p>
